% Here is a simple example of how to use MATLAB to perform QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) analysis for drug discovery:
% Load the data for the molecules
load('molecule_data.mat'); % assumes that the data is stored in a struct array called "molecules"

% Extract the molecular structures and activity values from the data
structures = {molecules.structure}; % cell array of molecular structures
activity = [molecules.activity]; % vector of activity values

% Convert the molecular structures to molecular fingerprints
fpLength = 2048; % length of the fingerprint
fpType = 'circular'; % type of fingerprint (options: 'circular', 'path', 'tree', 'morgan')
fpScale = 'count'; % scaling of the fingerprint (options: 'count', 'binary', 'normalized')
fingerprints = ECFP(structures, fpLength, fpType, fpScale);

% Split the data into training and test sets
nMolecules = length(activity);
nTrain = round(0.8 * nMolecules); % use 80% of the data for training
trainInd = 1:nTrain;
testInd = (nTrain+1):nMolecules;
Xtrain = fingerprints(trainInd,:); % training set inputs
Ytrain = activity(trainInd); % training set outputs
Xtest = fingerprints(testInd,:); % test set inputs
Ytest = activity(testInd); % test set outputs

% Train a model using the training data
model = fitlm(Xtrain, Ytrain); % fit a linear regression model

% Evaluate the model on the test data
Ytestpred = predict(model, Xtest); % predict the outputs for the test set
error = Ytestpred - Ytest; % compute the error between the predicted and true outputs
RMSE = sqrt(mean(error.^2)); % root mean squared error
R2 = 1 - sum(error.^2) / sum((Ytest - mean(Ytest)).^2); % coefficient of determination

% Print the results
fprintf('Root mean squared error: %f\n', RMSE);
fprintf('Coefficient of determination: %f\n', R2);
% This code assumes that you have a struct array called 'molecules' that contains the data for the molecules, 
% including their structures (stored as SMILES strings) and activity values. The molecular structures are 
% converted to molecular fingerprints using the ECFP (Extended Connectivity FingerPrint) algorithm, and the 
% data is split into training and test sets. A linear regression model is then fit to the training data and 
% used to predict the activity values for the test set. The root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of 
% determination (R2) are computed to evaluate the performance of the model.
