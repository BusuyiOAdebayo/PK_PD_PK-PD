% This code defines a PD model with an EC50 (concentration at which the response is 50% of the maximum response) of 10 mg/L, 
% a maximum response of 100, and a Hill coefficient of 4. The PD model is then evaluated at a series of concentration 
% points and the response is computed using a simple Hill equation. Finally, the response versus concentration curve is 
% plotted.
