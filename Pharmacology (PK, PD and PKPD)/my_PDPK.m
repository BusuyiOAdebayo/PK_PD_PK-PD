% This code combines the PK and PD models from the previous examples to create a PDPK model. The PK model is used to compute 
% the concentration of the drug at each time point, and the PD model is used to compute the response at each time point 
% based on the concentration. The response is then updated using a simple first-order PDPK equation. Finally, the response 
% versus time curve is plotted.
